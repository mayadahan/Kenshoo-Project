Server is the folder which contains the server (I used express package in order to build the server) with the required APIs.<br>
Analyzer.json is used as the DB, the data is kept in a json array, each item has the properites: imageId, Objects (array of descriptive words).<br>
Test include the testing code (using fetch), which checks mainly input validation and errors status.<br>
I had also tested the output manually using postman.<br>
